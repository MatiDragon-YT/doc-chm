<PRE class="bg-dark text-white p-2 m-1">GTA San Andreas Working Animations
(Note: For some of these to work, like IDLE_CHAT, you
will need to use TWO instances, i.e. one for the "talker"
and one for the "talkee". Also note that for a lot of
these, you MUST used the load_animation opcode first,
i.e load_animation "MISC")
